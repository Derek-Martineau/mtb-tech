          Trails in the Gordon College area - trails go from Wenham to Manchester and into the Chebacco Woods of Hamilton. Several different entrances and loops to be taken. Gravel fire roads criss-cross the woods, and trails of varying difficulty stem off of them.
In recent years trail additions or re-routes have been increasing the quality of riding in these woods.

          Lynn Woods, as the name suggests, is nestled within the town of Lynn Massachusetts. For those who are unfamiliar with Lynn, it is a low income industrial town about ten miles north east of Boston. If you were to drive through the somewhat run-down center of town you would never guess that you were close to best mountain biking Massachusetts and even New England has to offer. </p>
          <br>
        <p>Lynn woods is quite large, although I am not certain, I would estimate it to be at least 2,000 acres. The park consists of three lakes, the largest of which (Walden Pond, no, not the one made famous by Thoreau), divides the reservation into two distinct sections. To the South of Walden Pond is a maze of fire roads and single-track that even after two years of riding, I still find confusing. The terrain on this side is mostly easy to intermediate, and a lot of fun to explore. For the explorer there are two places that are of particular interest; the stone tower, and Dungeon Rock. No more then a 1/4 mile from the main parking lot, directly up a long steep hill is a 5 story stone tower, built in the 1930s. From the top of this tower one can get a majestic view of the Atlantic Ocean as well as a clear shot of the Boston skyline ten miles to the south. The climb to the top can be an adventure in its self, and don't be surprised if you find a few not-so-polite local teenagers hanging out on the roof. Heading down the other side of the hill with the tower for another 1/4 mile or so you will encounter Dungeon Rock. Created by a treasure hunter in the 1800s, Dungeon Rock is cave blasted into and beneath an enormous boulder. As the legend goes pirates supposedly buried treasure underneath that rock, and some poor sap spent his entire life searching for it, by digging his way through solid rock. Although he was not successful, the treasure hunter did leave behind a very interesting piece of work. The entrance to Dungeon Rock is sealed with a cast iron door, that is supposed to be locked. However, every time I have been there the lock on the steel door was broken (probably a service provided by the same kids that hang out on t he top of the tower), and entry was possible. It's dark in there </p>
          <br>
        <p>To the north of Walden Pond are the trails that make Lynn Woods unique. If you are new to the sport of mountain biking you probably won't want to ride on this side. To those who are experienced technical riders, you will never want to leave. The best way to describe the terrain is ROCKS! Yes everything from small loose gravel, to boulders the size of a small house. It is awesome. If you are new to this type of terrain it will take a little getting used to, but it will be worth it. Personally, I like meandering over the huge boulders that dot the landscape. For those who are interested just head up the hill towards to water tower, and follow the white dotted trail from there. The water tower can be easily seen from any clearing. This trail is nothing short of amazing. On a sunny Saturday, don't be surprised to pass fifty or more other riders in this area, it has become quite popular for good reason. Have a blast, and although it may not seem like it the first time you ride it, it is possible to ride the entire white dotted trail without falling.</p>

        <p>Why would anyone want to ride in she Willowdale State Forest when right across the street is the much better known Bradley Palmer State Forest? Well, maybe it's because the forest's 2400 acres hold over 40 miles of trails. Or maybe it's because you normally have the entire place to yourself. Whatever the reason Willowdale State Forest should be high on everyone's list for exploration. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Willowdale State Forest is located mostly in the town of Ipswich. Many of the forest's trails are easy doubletracks, which makes Willowdale an excellent place for family friendly riding. And there are a three color coded marked loops to follow. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The forest's singletrack trails are some of the most enjoyable trails that I have ever ridden. The best of these lay in northern section of the Pine Swamp area. The forest is divided up into two main parecels. The aforementioned Pine Swamp area and the Hood Pond area. Most people park on Ipswich Road alongside the Ipswich River. You'll find numbered markers at all of the forest's main intersections. Bring a copy of the maps and you'll always know where you are. The Bay Circuit Trail runs through Willowdale and is marked by white blazes. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Plan to spend more than one day exploring Willowdale's many trails. Looking for more riding? Well, just across that bridge on the Ipswich River you'll find Bradley Palmer State Park and Georgetown-Rowley State Forest is also nearby. And for a truely epic ride you can link all three together. </p>
        <br>
        <p>For a good exploratory ride print out the Pine Swamp MAP. Then take a highlighter and outline the following route. Head north into the forest from the parking area and turn left at marker 31. Follow that trail to 35 and then to 33, 36, 45, 49, 30, 12, 11, 40, 43, 41, 39, 38, 37 27, 26, 25, 24 and then take the Bay Circuit Path down through 4, 5, 60, 30, 32, 22 & 42. At that point you'll have over 9 miles on your clock and will have sampled some of Willowdale's best trails. Oh And remember all those trails leading off from this ride? They are just more reasons to head out again. </p>
        <br>
        <p>  Want something else to do while you're there? Check out the Willodale Estate in the contiguous Bradley Plamer State Forest. Or, rent a kayak or a canoe a half mile away at Foote Brothers. </p>
